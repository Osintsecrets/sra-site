          <p>My journey into Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) started with curiosity. A conversation between Griffin Glynn and Micah Hoffman on David Bombal’s channel pulled me in. I realized OSINT isn’t reserved for insiders—you can learn it with the right mindset: explore, verify, and connect dots.</p>

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">First Steps: Applying OSINT</h2>
          <p>I built a huge Start.me list of tools, tested them, and—with consent—ran small investigations for friends. Each case felt like a puzzle: searching, cross-referencing, uncovering the detail that opens everything else.</p>

        <section>
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">OSINT for Good</h2>
          <p>Inspired by groups like Trace Labs, Skull Games, and Operation Safe Escape, I focused on responsibility. Knowledge should be shared and used to protect—not to harm. That thinking led to OSINT Secrets: make OSINT accessible, ethical, and useful.</p>

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">Choosing the Light</h2>
          <p>I once pictured myself hunting bad actors. Over time I understood the emotional cost of that work—something Nico Dekens (“The Dutch OSINT Guy”) talks about openly. I chose a different path: education. Help people avoid harm by understanding exposure.</p>
          <p>My Social Risk Audit work comes from that choice: surface what’s public, explain realistic misuse, and put the decision to change in your hands.</p>

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">Ethics: Privacy First</h2>
          <ul class="mt-3 list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
            <li>Privacy is a basic human right—full stop.</li>
            <li>Public does not mean “fair game.” Doxing is unacceptable.</li>
            <li>Disagreement or politics never justify exposing someone.</li>
            <li>My role is to analyze and educate—not to judge or punish. If there’s a crime, the authorities handle it.</li>
          </ul>

        <section>
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">Always Learning</h2>
          <p>OSINT evolves constantly. I keep studying—interviews, books, podcasts, tools, and methods. The goal stays the same: pursue knowledge and use it responsibly.</p>
